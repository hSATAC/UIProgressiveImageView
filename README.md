UIProgressiveImageView
======================

And UIImageView subclass of displaying images from Internet progressively.

Display the image progressively whlie downloading,  just like web browser does. It's easy to use, a simple line of `[imageView loadImageWithURL:url];` will do the trick.



The origin code and idea were coming from [Nyx0uf's post](http://www.cocoaintheshell.com/2011/05/progressive-images-download-imageio/)
